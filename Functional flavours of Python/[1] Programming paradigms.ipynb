    "Nobody in computer science came up with the idea that first we need to create a finite set of programming paradigms and then create programming languages that'll fit one of those well defined cases. Paradigms are more of an afterthought that tries to bundle together some similarities of various programming languages. In fact programming languages rarely fit just one paradigm, they seem to borrow ideas from different programming paradigms.\n",

It's not even about objects as constructs, in fact it's all about message passing between objects. Won't dive deep into any of that, but I highly recommend reading about Alan Kay and OOP, [maybe start with this message](http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html).\n",
